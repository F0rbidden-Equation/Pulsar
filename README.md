## Presentations :
###  The Pulsar project and a set of programs, intended for the operation of radio frequencies, this program brings together several programs in order to simplify the radio frequency signal analysis mainly, using the structure of Gnuradio and the program Hack Rf, the program automaton and articulated on several functions, Automaton for use, simple, fast and efficient.
